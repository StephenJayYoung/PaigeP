        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">The band of tissue connecting the tongue to the floor of the mouth is called the lingual frenum, while the band connecting the lip to the gum in front of the teeth is called the labial frenum. Occasionally a frenum might be exceptionally short, thick, or tight, or may extend too far down along the tongue or the gum. When a frenum is positioned in such a way as to interfere with the normal alignment of teeth, speech or constricts the movement of the tongue or lips, it can be removed with a very simple surgery called a frenectomy.</div>
