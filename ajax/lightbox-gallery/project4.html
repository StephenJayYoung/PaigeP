        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">Sedation Dentistry, sometimes referred to as Sleep Dentistry, provides a safe, effective way to alleviate dental anxiety and provide patients with the treatment they need. Oral sedation is for patients who experience anxiety about going to the dentist or avoid dental work. Intravenous (or IV) sedation is an excellent method of treatment for patients who have severe dental anxiety or extensive dental needs. Call us for a free consultation.
