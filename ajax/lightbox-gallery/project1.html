        Many regular dental treatments can be performed using porcelain and composite materials instead of metal. Modern tooth-colored restorations are virtually invisible compared to traditional silver or gold. We offer smile-whitening, porcelain veneers, tooth-colored crowns and fillings and more to patients looking to brighten up their smiles.
